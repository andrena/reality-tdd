# TDD in the Real World

This repository provides the materials from a tutorial about "TDD in the Real
World", given by the four of us at the 2012 [_Entwicklertag_ conference in
Karlsruhe](http://entwicklertag.de).

For this tutorial, we have developed a new approach to coaching TDD as a _skill
and habit_, rather than just as a technique and tool. Along with the materials,
we also explain some of the background in our [blog](http://andrena.github.com/reality-tdd/blog/).
