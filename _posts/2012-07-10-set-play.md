_This post belongs to a three-part introduction to our approach. Read the
other parts here:_

*   The didactics of test-driven development 
*   TDD as a skill and habit
*   Set-piece play (this post)

## Set-piece play

In football (or soccer, if you're American), there is a special kind of 
situation in the game which is called 'set-piece play'. A direct free kick is
a good example: if the game was interrupted after an attacking player has 
suffered foul play, the attacking team can start the game with a free shot,
the ball lying in a resting position. It's the kind of situation that leads
often to scoring; part of the reason is of course that the shot can be taken
undisturbed by opponent attacks, but it's also because such situations can 
be practiced and planned much better than in-play situations. Set play leaves
you more in control, and there is a limited number of patterns for which you
can train.

(In German, the term is 'Standardsituationen', literally 'standard situations'.
This emphasizes the aspect of a routine pattern even more.)

Even if a team has to fight a stronger opponent that is difficult to predict,
there is at least one good strategy towards winning then: practice hard to use
set play as effectively as you can. 

And what goes in sports works also in coding, TDD-style. Even if you're facing
a large and unwieldy code base, one which was grown without automated tests
in mind, or one that has proliferated our of any proportion, you will still
regularly encounter certain situations in which you can be at least partly in
control: that's where you can score.

The kind of situations we have in mind have some characteristics similar to
set-piece situations in football: 

*   they happen fairly frequently; 
*   they can be recognized easily (more or less);
*   because they have a typical structure, there is also a typical strategy 
    for each of them, which is well-known and time-proven.

For our approach we have cataloged eleven such situations. (It's a pure 
accident that this number equals the number of players in a football team.)
We use them for several purposes:

*   to teach how to recognize the crucial points in a real-world code base 
    where you can make a start and write some test cases; 
*   to strengthen prospective memory: to remember to write tests when you come
    along a specific situation (it is easier to form an intention to do
    something, like writing a test case, if you have a specific scenario in 
    mind);
*   to make sure that you have a strategy for finding test cases once you've
    recognized a suitable place;
*   to have some starting points for 'developing the eye' - building up the 
    cognitive capacity to find ways to write tests; 
*   to have some variety of occasions for developing a habit of writing unit 
    tests.

The catalog is our central element in all this. (You can download it [in the
downloads section here on this site](http://andrena.github.com/reality-tdd/).)
We have devised several exercises which are all centered around it, and we
provide it as a starting point that you may extend after some time.

On this blog, we will go into the technical detail with respect to the entries
in the catalog; we will also add some background information about the 
didactics and the psychology behind our approach.
